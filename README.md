This bash script engages the vivado linter and simulator through the shell without the need for any other scripts. You need to specify the file name for the top module, other modules are scanned from the directory. The top module's name needs to match its filename (without the extension). If any of the submodules are SystemVerilog, the top module should also be SystemVerilog (have the `.sv` extension).

Example usage: `xsim_bash top.sv --nolog --delete`

`--nolog` tells the tools not to generate log files (they sometimes listen), `--delete` tells the script to delete all files generated by the tool after running. The script will confirm before it deletes any file that already existed when you launched it.

In order for the script to run you need to have the vivado bin directory in your `PATH`. Also consider adding the script to your `PATH` so you can access it from anywhere in your system.

The script will only scan the directory it's run in for modules other than the top module. While having the top module itself in a different directory would work, it is not recommended.

If you're using vscode and want to use this script as a run task, you can define the following task in your `tasks.json`:
```json
"tasks": [
    {
        "label": "Vivado simulator",
        "type": "shell",
        "command": "xsim_bash ${file} --nolog --delete"
    }
]
```
